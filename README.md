# Self_supervised_pretraining_ViT_UNETR

This is based on the self-supervised pretraining tutorial from MONAI:
https://github.com/Project-MONAI/tutorials/tree/main/self_supervised_pretraining/vit_unetr_ssl

Which again is based on the following article:
Tang, Yucheng, Dong Yang, Wenqi Li, Holger R. Roth, Bennett Landman, Daguang Xu, Vishwesh Nath, and Ali Hatamizadeh. "Self-supervised pre-training of swin transformers for 3d medical image analysis." In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 20730-20740. 2022.
